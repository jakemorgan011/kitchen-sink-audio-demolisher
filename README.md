# kitchen-sink-audio-demolisher
width based threshold audio processor.

Temporary UI.
updating the colors for faster understanding.

this version creates a working dsp but i'm not sure how to make some things work.
1. I can't figure out how to save the state of the handles.
2. The thresholds aren't overlapping at the moment.
